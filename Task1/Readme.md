# Interactive To-Do List Application

## Objective
Create a simple to-do list app where users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them.

## Requirements
- - Use DOM manipulation to create, update, and delete list items.
- Attach event listeners for adding tasks and toggling their completion status.
- Optionally store tasks in an array (or even in `localStorage` for persistence).
