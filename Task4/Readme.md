# Weather App with API Integration

## Objective
Create a weather app that fetches and displays weather information based on a city name input.
## Requirements
- Use the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- Parse the JSON response and update the DOM with temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- Implement error handling for invalid input or failed network requests.
